# Assignment-2-to-5
Assignment-2 on  Control Structures in Python
It Includes Task 1:  Number is Even or Odd
                   > 	Takes an integer input from the user.
                   > 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
            Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
                   >   Usesing a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
                   >   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
                   >   Displays the final sum.


Assignment-3 on Functions & Modules in Python 
  It includes Task 1:- Factorial Using a Function
                        > Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
                        > Returns the calculated factorial.
                        > Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
              Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
                        > Square root of the number
                        > Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
                        > Sine of the number (in radians)

Assignment-4 on Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
   It includes Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
                        > Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
                        > Prints its content line by line.
                        > Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
                Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
                        > Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
                        > Appends additional data to the same file.
                        > Reads and displays the final content of the file.

Assignment-5 on Data Structures and Strings in Python
                Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks
                        > Created a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
                        > Asks the user to input a student's name.
                        > Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
                        > If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.
